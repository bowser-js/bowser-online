# bowser online

A website to test [bowser](https://github.com/lancedikson/bowser).


## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the site:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

It generates the `docs/` folder with the HTML, JS and CSS files that should be deployed in your web server.

This command must be run before pushing to `master` master branch so the site will be updated in gitHub Pages.


## Development

Open the website in a browser with `browserSync`:

```bash
$ npm run live
```
